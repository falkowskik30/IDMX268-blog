Kate is is a very nerdy soul with a strong affinity for baked goods despite knowing she's not supposed to eat cake for breakfast. 

While she used to be a AA athlete, she now casually puts on her goalie gear on Saturday nights and faces the brutal torture that is "Junior Hockey Players". For some reason she still finds it fun.
