While they’re hundreds, even thousands of fonts at your disposal on any given day they all can be broken down to fit into four categories. ___

Serif typefaces are probably what everyone is most familiar with. It’s the fonts used when you print out your research papers, read the newspaper, or when you look in a book. What makes serif typefaces so popular is the little adorations helping our eyes form connections between individual letters, allowing the brain to pick up words faster. There are several different types of serif typefaces:

**Old-styl**e serifs date back to the 15th-18th centuries and include the first Roman types. They’re fairly undramatic and are recognizable by the lack of stroke-weight contrast in its letters.

**Transitional** serifs serve as an in-between for old-style and neoclassical typefaces. They allow for finer character strokes and have a greater stroke-weight contrast than its old-style counterpart.

**Neoclassical** serifs were created in the late 18th century and were thought to be redesigns of classic typefaces, however, it was later discovered they were completely new fonts. They tend to feature more rounded shapes at the beginning and end of the stroke.

**Slab** typefaces were popular in the 19th century for advertisements. It has little to weight variation in its strokes and looks a lot like sans-serif fonts with a heavy serif added on to it.

**Clarendon** fonts were first released in the early 19th century and are characterized by their short to medium serif lengths. They also feature more variety in stroke weights.

**Glyphic** fonts imitate stone inscriptions more than they do pen-drawn text. Their serifs tend to be more triangular.

The next most common typeface is Sans-Serif (literally meaning “without serif”). Arguably existing as far back as ancient times, the choice to remove serifs wasn't done deliberately until the 19th century. They create balance with stroke weights rather than serifs.

**Grotesque** typefaces generally have a square-like quality to the curves of their letters. An easy way to spot them is by the “bowl and loop” design in the letter ‘g’.

**Square** sans-serif fonts feature a dramatic squaring of curves. Because they are more difficult to read in bulk, they are primarily used for display designs.

**Humanistic** fonts are known as one of the easiest sans-serif fonts to read. This is thanks to the apparent variation in stroke weights and how the letters are spaced.

**Geometric** typefaces are heavily influenced by simple geometric shapes. Because of their blocky nature, they tend to be less readable than their counterparts.

Script typefaces are ever-increasing in popularity due to the wide variety of moods and characteristics they offer. They are derived from traditional calligraphy and handwriting.

**Formal** script typefaces are inspired by 17th-century formal writing styles. Many characters have strokes that connect them to other letters and, because of their cursive nature, can be harder to read. These types of script fonts are not ideal for working in capslock.

**Casual** fonts mimic everyday handwriting and suggest informality in their nature. They are designed to appear as if they were written quickly, but not as quick as that one doctor with super messy handwriting.

**Calligraphic** typefaces mimic… calligraphic writing! And they can be connecting or non-connecting in design.

**Blackletter and Lombardic** styled fonts are inspired by manuscript lettering before the invention of moveable type.

The final font style is decorative. It is the largest category of fonts and also the most diverse, however, they are rarely used for lengthy amounts of text. They are most often used for signs, headlines, and anywhere where a strong statement is desired. They can use unorthodox letter shapes to achieve more dramatic results and some even appear three-dimensional!
