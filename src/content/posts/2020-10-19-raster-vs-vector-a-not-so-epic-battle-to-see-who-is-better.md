As we browse the wide expanse of the internet, we tend to come across two main types of image files. Raster and vector. Both have their advantages in the graphic field, however, they can’t be used interchangeably (not conveniently, at least). Where one file type lacks, the other is there to make up for it. So whether you are printing 30+ copies of that one cat photo you found online or are making shirts for your company, there’s a graphic-type perfectly suited for you.

The first image file we’ll talk about is raster images.

If you’ve been on the internet, chances are high that you’ve come across several thousands of these types of images as they are far more common than their mathematical counterpart. With file extensions like jpg, gif, and png, raster images are something almost every user is familiar with.

Raster images are created in pixel-based computer programs when you take a picture with a digital camera, and with a scanner. The image is recorded as ‘pixel-data’ and, once uploaded, the result is a raster image.

Because they’re made by “painting” an image, since the pixels blend and transition smoothly from one color to another, raster images are much better suited for photo-like images. They are popular for being both rich in color and brightness gradation and for the ability to edit individual pixels within an image.

Some popular pixel-based programs are Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, Corel PaintShop Pro, Clip Studio Paint, including several free programs that can be downloaded from online.

While raster images may be better for digital display, keeping it looking clean becomes more of a challenge. Maintaining the quality of a raster image is dependent on two things: the pixel dimension of the image (ex: 2550px wide by 3892px high) and the pixel resolution (pixels per inch required by a printer).  The more pixels there are in an image, the higher quality it will be once exported. That being said, to obtain high-quality graphics your computer needs a greater amount of memory.

Unlike vectors, raster graphics cannot be scaled without losing quality since pixels are a single point on a screen while vectors are mathematical equations created by a computer program. Because of this, no matter which direction you scale it, a vector will look the same. Elements like fonts are the same way; whether they are sized up or down, they retain their quality.

Vector graphics are created with vector-specific software and are usually used for images that will be applied to a physical product; however, they are also used in CAD, engineering, and 3D graphics. They are typically made by drawing the outline of shapes and filling with them.

These types of files (SVG, eps, pdf, ai, dxf) are created and saved as a sequence of vector statements, resulting in a much smaller file than a raster graphic.

Some popular vector-based programs include Adobe Illustrator, Corel Draw, Inkscape.

However, vector graphics are not suitable for complex graphic displays, since they do not blend the colors as well as raster graphics, and they require rasterization for display. On the other hand, raster graphics can be quite laborious to trace for vector.

Just because raster graphics provide a wide range of hues, colors, and is the go-to file format for memes doesn’t always mean it’s best suited for the major billboard on the highway. And just because vector images are incapable of losing image quality doesn’t mean it’s the best choice for creating a major piece of artwork. Both image types have their strengths and weaknesses as well as the fields they are best suited for. Which you choose ultimately comes down to what kind of work you are doing and how the final product is going to be displayed.

Remember! You paint with pixels and you draw with vectors!
