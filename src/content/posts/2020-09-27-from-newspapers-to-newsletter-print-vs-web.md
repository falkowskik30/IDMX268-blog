*Print fonts and web fonts.*

At first glance you may ask yourself, “what’s the big deal? They’re all fonts,” or “I’m sure they’re all the same, what’s the difference?” However, there *is* a difference and you can see its importance once you take a closer look.

Even though a font may be fundamentally the same, the differences appear when you look at where the font is being used. For example, fonts designed for the web are created to enhance readability and performance in a variety of digital environments. On the other hand, print-based fonts are designed for physical, printed works such as books and newspapers.

One early example of fonts adapting for the web takes us back to some of the first digital screens. Because these old screens were unable to render serif-fonts properly sans-serif fonts quickly became the norm for digital work and this is still often seen today (just take a look at your text messages and the words on this screen!).

But what is the difference between print and web? Sure, the medium changes, but does that warrant a whole new breed of fonts? Let’s take a look at these two fonts.

While the changes are subtle, the thicker strokes make it much easier to read on the screen with a heavy appearance.

**The Best Fonts for Print and Web**

A general rule of thumb is if you’re content is digital is to go with a sans-serif font and a serif font for print.

With their simple shapes and uniform width, sans-serif fonts are easier to read online. As serif fonts shrink, either in size or with the screen, the embellishments become harder to read and the letters become harder to read.

Serif fonts are optimal for print due to the embellishments making the letters more distinctive and therefore easier for our brains to recognize.
